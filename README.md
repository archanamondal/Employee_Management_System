This is a Employee Management System implemented in Java. It allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records. The system also includes additional features such as searching for employees by name, position, or ID, and error handling for file I/O operations and user inputs.

CRUD Operations: Add, view, update, and delete employee records.
Search Functionality: Search employees by name, position, or ID.
Data Storage: Employee records are stored using serialization to maintain data between program executions.
Input Validation: Validate user inputs to ensure data integrity (e.g., salary must be a positive number).
Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully for file I/O operations and user inputs.

Compile and Run: Compile the Main.java file and run the Main class. This serves as the entry point for the application.
